# DiscordEmoteYoinker
Interface to take emotes from a server and sends them to another in a convenient UI!
### Usage
Place your token in the top box (hide and show if you want that extra layer of privacy). I can't be bothered to write a tutorial for getting that, and I don't even know the right way, so you'll have to google that part.

Place the source and target server ID in the next two boxes.

Press "Download" to see all the emotes from that server. Select the ones you want with a click. If you want to select a bunch, shift-click one, then shift click another and all the ones between will be selected. There's also a "Select All" button.

Finally, press "Upload" to send all the emotes to the target server.
